==============

A mail sending application which sends you an e-mail if any content dynamically appears in the website . 
In this case , website being http://www.pes.edu and the content being results . 
This helps me because i don't have to be online and check when my results come out .

Use case

==============

Used only for detecting information and sending you an e-mail .
